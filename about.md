I started this website in order to have a place where I could explain myself
and keep tracking of my research, thoughts and writings. As I am a computer
engineer, I wanted to do it the most hand-made I could. So that I can learn in
the process.

Firstly, my mother language is Spanish. I apologize about likely mistakes and
sections written completrly in Spanish.

Secondly, I write in English this introduction because I like to force my mind
to think in English.

Finally, I hope you enjoy the content and share it social-network-wide.
