                    <p>
                        I am currently employed as DevOps, although I know this
                        should be just a philosophy. While I have a Development
                        background focused in Backend I am able to review, fix
                        and improve in Frontend as well. Back then, I switched
                        to this field to make more visible from development teams
                        all monitoring, deployment and testing performance tasks.
                        Now I'm doing my best to provide it from the inside.
                        I'm also learning Rust on my spare time.

                    <p><i>Cegedim, Mar 2020 - Present</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Migration from static servers into Kubernetes clusters.
                        We have used Helm to provide an Environment as code package.
                        I'm also doing my part with Docker, pipelines (migration
                        from Jenkins to GitlabCI) and deployment process standardization
                        through multiple company services.
                        We keep an eye on Dynatrace, graphana and Kibana, and help
                        development teams with dashboards that help them understand
                        better what's happening in their sevices.

                    <p>
                        As a consulting company, I performed different roles in different
                        clients. Here is the description of roles and actions performed in
                        them:
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        ADP: Development of automated and secure
                        processes for hosting with high administration levels security and
                        combining dedicated servers and Kubernetes clusters.
                    </li>

                        TomTom Webfleet Solution: Beginnings of a DevOps team
                        in order to improve the knowledge and eficiency of each environment
                        from a development perspective.

                    <li>
                        Privalia: Migration from monolith to microservices
                        using Springboot and React. Here I started to use Docker, Spinnaker
                        and a little of Terraform to put all this services into production.
                        This was my first contact with DevOps philosphy.

                        In-edit or Sonar. Most of the development were done using JavaScript
                        and Scala, but using their own custom frameworks.
